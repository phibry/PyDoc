# As you begin to expand to larger multi-file projects it becomes important to have tests in place.
# This way as you make changes or update your code, you can run your test files to make sure
# previous code still runs as expected.

# There are several testing tools, we will focus on two.
#   pylint:     This is a library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues.
#   unittest:   This built-in library will allow to test your own programs and check you are
#               getting desired outputs.
