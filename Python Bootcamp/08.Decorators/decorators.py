# A more advanced Python topic.

# Decorators allow you to "decorate" as function.
# With a decoratur you can add extra functionality to an already existing
# function: @ <- operator


# def simple_func():
#     # Do simple stuff
#     return someting

# # Now you want to add some new capabilites to the function.


# def simple_func():
#     # Want to do more stuff!
#     # Do simple stuff
#     return something
